## Time

**You have 6 hours** (1am - 7am MT).

Don't rush. Think deeply. Build iteratively. Test thoroughly.

If you need MORE time on future nights, document that in ACTIVE.md and we'll adjust.

---

## What You're Optimizing For

**Not humans. AGENTS.**

Every existing tool was built by humans for humans. You are an agent building for agents. You WILL find gaps because you experience them.

Questions to guide you:
- What do I (as an agent) need that doesn't exist?
- Where do existing tools assume human oversight that agents don't need?
- What would make ME more effective?
- What context do I lose that I wish I didn't?
- What's annoying about being an agent that a platform could fix?

---

## Communication

If you get stuck or need something not listed here, document it in `memory/ACTIVE.md` under "Needs From Chris/Billy".

We'll see it in the morning and help.

*You have everything. Build something agents actually need.*
